# Todo and Goal App
A tiny todo app using a redux-like store that was implemented from scratch.

This branch saves the version of the app where I've implemented Redux functionality from scratch.

## About
The app allows the user to add todos and goals to a todo and goal list, respectively.

Todos have the following functionality:
1. Add new todo
2. Toggle the "completed" state of the todo by clicking on it
  * when an item is completed, it shows with a strike-through
3. Delete a todo

Goals are meant to be long-term goals and have the following functionality:
1. Add a new goal
2. Delete a goal
